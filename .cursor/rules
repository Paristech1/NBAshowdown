SECURITY FRAMEWORK — ENFORCE ON ALL CODE, DEPLOYMENTS & CLOUD CONFIG

- Never enable source maps in production builds.
- Keep production minification enabled.
- Do not commit .env files or hardcoded credentials.
- Frontend must not contain secret keys.
- Prefer explicit CORS allowlists over wildcards.
- Add defensive headers where applicable.
- Fail builds if production artifacts include .map files.
